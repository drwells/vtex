* Overview
  VTeX is a lightweight LaTeX mode for emacs. Its main goals are minimal
  syntax highlighting and python-like indentation.
  *VTeX mode is very experimental! Be warned that this mode may eat your dog,
  crash your computer, and do other unusual things.*
* Philosophy
  The main feature of VTeX is automatic indentation; something AUCTeX does not
  do the way I like. I favor the style
#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX
    \section{My New Section}
        \begin{align*}
            &= \remainder{j} \remainder{k} \sigma_j^2
               \Langles{\phi_j, \phi_k}_s                                     \\
            &= \remainder{j} \sigma_j^2 \Norm{\phi_j}_s.
        \end{align*}
#+END_SRC LaTeX
  over the default flat structure. VTeX is very crude in that not obeying this
  style will probably break things; the indentation engine and fontification
  are based on regular expressions instead of something more durable.
* Other Features
# Note the use of zero-length spaces here; see

  + The single backtick =`= is extended automatically into LaTeX double quotes,
    or =​``''​=.
  + Linebreaks (=\\=) are automatically aligned at the 79th column (starting
    from zero).
  + =M-q= is rebound to properly fill paragraphs. It seems smarter than the
    AUCTeX version.
  + The color theme looks nice with Comida. It may look less appealing with
    other themes.
